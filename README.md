# JSON2HTML-parser

This is a simple yet effective json parser which converts json files into corresponding HTML files with proper visualization. We provide two equivalent implementations in Haskell and Go.

## Usage

We briefly introduce the usage of this parser.

### Haskell Program

The Haskell program can be run by command ":run main", where input file name and output file name will be "input.json" and "output.html"

And it can run with one argument given, which is the name of input file, i.e., ":run main input.json", where "input.json" can be replaced by the name of the input file.

Also, it can run with two arguments, which are the name of input and output files, correspondingly. For example, ":run main input.json output.html".

### Go Program

The Go program can be run like this "go run a2.go input.json > json.html"
